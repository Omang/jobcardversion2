Installation
------------

Using npm:

```
npm install ng-audio
```

How to use it
-------------

You should already have script required for Angular, note sanitize module use.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="angular.min.js"></script>
```

to the list above, you should add:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="ng-audio.min.css">
```

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="ng-audio.min.js"></script>
```

Then, inject `ngAudio` in your application module:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['ngAudio']);
```

and then just add an `div` with `audio` directive name attribute, `options` scope variable attribute.

```html
<div audio options="options" />
```

'options' slider scope options value as json.

```javascript
$scope.options = {
  playlist: ['/sound/SoundHelix-Song-1.mp3', '/sound/SoundHelix-Song-1.mp3'],
  loop: true
};
```

### Options

Options for your audio in json format {playlist:.....}

* `playlist`: list of sound url to load ( CORS, so be careful delivered by your server )
* `loop`: loop sound
* `start`: TODO : start sound

### Build

You can run the tests by running

```
npm install
```
or
```
npm test
```

assuming you already have `grunt` installed, otherwise you also need to do:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
